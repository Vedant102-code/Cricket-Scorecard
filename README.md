Key data structures include:teamScore: Tracks total runs, wickets, balls bowled, and completed overs.matchStats: Objects storing individual player stats (runs, balls faced, wickets, economy).matchState: Tracks the current Striker, Non-Striker, and Bowler to handle rotation logic.Chase Calculation (2nd Innings)When the 1st innings ends, the data is archived. The score2.html page initializes with the target score. The logic adapts to display Target instead of Projected Score and calculates the Runs Needed and Balls Remaining for the RRR display.🤝 ContributingContributions are welcome!
